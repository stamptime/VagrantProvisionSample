# Vagrant Environment Provisioning Sample.
## Description:
This project uses vagrant to create 2 VM's by default, both machines are provisioned and configured as a GitHub Runner at the global organization settings.
- The VM 1 is provisioned with Docker.
- The VM 2 is provisioned with Podman.

VM 1 uses a docker-compose.yml file that creates and exposes the following containers and ports:

||||
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sonarqube-service` | `ports: 9000`<br>`image: sonarqube:alpine`|<h7>[_open_](http://localhost:9000)</h7>|
| `jenkins-service` | `ports: 8080, 8082` <br>`image: jenkins:2.60.3-alpine`|<h7>[_open_](http://localhost:8080)</h7>|
| `nexus-service` | `ports: 8081` <br>`image: sonatype/nexus3` |<h7>[_open_](http://localhost:8081)</h7>|
| `postgres-service` | `ports: 5432` <br>`image: postgres:alpine`|***not displayable***|
| `portainer-service` | `ports: 9443, 8000` <br>`image: portainer/portainer-ce:alpine`|<h7>[_open_](https://localhost:9443/)</h7>|

## Requirements:
* Vagrant and VirtualBox installed
* Personal Github Token
* You need to create a local.yml file at the same level of the Vagrantfile


#### Recommendations:
To avoid `Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot` on windows OS we recommend to disable "Hyper V", "Windows hypervisor platform" and "Virtual machine platform" windows features.
